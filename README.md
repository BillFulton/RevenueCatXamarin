# RevenueCatXamarin
Bill Fulton

Sample code for accessing RevenueCat in-app functions from Xamarin.Forms.
Should be close to working for .NET MAUI.

Not a complete sample app, just code providing an API you could use in your Xamarin.Forms app.
See IRevenueCat.cs for API definitions.

You'll need to replace my product codes with your own.

Status at 23 February 2023:
iOS and Android code tested in my own app; my iOS app recently in production; my Android app in final beta and shortly to be promoted to production.

Free for use. All care taken, no responsibility :)
